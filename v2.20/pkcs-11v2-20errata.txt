This note lists known errors in PKCS #11: Cryptographic Token
Interface Standard, version 2.20, and should be incorporated into that
version.

1. Incorrect examples in Section 11.7

The example for C_CreateObject incorrectly specifies the "application"
attribute as CK_CHAR string. It shall be a CK_UTF8CHAR string, and in
the attribute template the length (sizeof) shall be subtracted by one
(no terminating NULL character).

The example for C_GetObjectSize incorrectly specifies the "application"
attribute as CK_CHAR string. It shall be CK_UTF8CHAR string, and in
the attribute template the length (sizeof) shall be subtracted by one
(no terminating NULL character).

2. Missing mechanisms in Table 34, Section 12

Table 34 misses several of the new mechanisms. The following rows
should be added to Table 34:

                    Encrypt/  Sign/  SR &  Digest Gen.Key  Wrap/  Derive
                    Decrypt  Verify   VR                  Unwrap
                    ----------------------------------------------------
CKM_BLOWFISH_KEY_GEN                                  x
CKM_BLOWFISH_CBC      x                                      x
CKM_TWOFISH_KEY_GEN                                   x
CKM_TWOFISH_CBC       x                                      x
CKM_DES_OFB64         x                                       
CKM_DES_OFB8          x                                       
CKM_DES_CFB64         x                               
CKM_DES_CFB8          x                                       

3. Missing definition for CK_AES_CBC_ENCRYPT_DATA_PARAMS_PTR

Section 12.14.1 erroneously duplicates the typedef for
CK_DES_CBC_ENCRYPT_DATA_PARAMS_PTR. Instead, the last typedef of
Section 12.14.1 should read:

typedef CK_AES_CBC_ENCRYPT_DATA_PARAMS CK_PTR
        CK_AES_CBC_ENCRYPT_DATA_PARAMS_PTR;

4. Incorrect attribute name CKA_UNEXTRACTABLE

Section 11.1.6 incorrectly mentions a non-existent CKA_UNEXTRACTABLE
attribute in the description of the return values
CKR_KEY_NOT_WRAPPABLE and CKR_KEY_UNEXTRACTABLE. The correct text for
these two return values shall be:

- CKR_KEY_NOT_WRAPPABLE: Although the specified private or secret key
  does not have its CKA_EXTRACTABLE attribute set to CK_FALSE,
  Cryptoki (or the token) is unable to wrap the key as requested
  (possibly the token can only wrap a given key with certain types of
  keys, and the wrapping key specified is not one of these
  types). Compare with CKR_KEY_UNEXTRACTABLE.

- CKR_KEY_UNEXTRACTABLE: The specified private or secret key can’t be
  wrapped because its CKA_EXTRACTABLE attribute is set to CK_FALSE.
  Compare with CKR_KEY_NOT_WRAPPABLE.

5. Incorrect parameter name in description of C_SignEncryptUpdate

In Section 11.13, the first paragraph describing the parameters for
C_SignEncryptUpdate erroneously refers to pulEncryptedPart. This
should be pulEncryptedPartLen.

6. Incorrect return value in description of C_OpenSession

In the description of C_OpenSession in Section 11.6, the second
paragraph shall refer to CKR_SESSION_PARALLEL_NOT_SUPPORTED, and not
CKR_PARALLEL_NOT_SUPPORTED.

7. Incorrect description of CKF_SO_PIN_LOCKED in Table 11

Table 11 (in Section 9.2) contains an incorrect description for
CKF_SO_PIN_LOCKED. The description shall read:

	True if the SO PIN has been locked. SO login to 
	the token is not possible.

8. Incorrect reference to C_InitToken in Table 11

In two places (in the description of CKF_TOKEN_INITIALIZED) Table 11
incorrectly refers to C_InitializeToken. This should be changed to
C_InitToken.

9. Garbled text in Table 11

In two places (in the description of CKF_USER_PIN_FINAL_TRY and
CKF_SO_PIN_FINAL_TRY) Table 11 contains the text "will it to", this
text shall be replaced with "will cause the token to".

10. Incorrect reference to C_InitToken in Table 19

The description of the CKA_RESET_ON_INIT attribute incorrectly refers
to C_InitializeToken. This shall be changed to C_InitToken.

11. Incorrect footnote reference in Table 24

The footnote referenced in the CKA_VALUE entry shall be footnote 2,
note footnote 1.

12. Incorrect mechanism identifier in Section 12.23.3

Section 12.23.3 references CKM_SHA256_HMAC_GENERAL. This should be
CKM_SHA384_HMAC_GENERAL.

13. Clarification of TLS version number in Section 12.32.4

Add the following section at the end of the second paragraph of
Section 12.32.4:

"The CK_VERSION structure should have the version value {3, 1} for
TLS version 1.0."

14. Incorrect examples in Section 11.6

The example in the description of C_Logout shall subtract one from the
length of userPIN, i.e. replace: sizeof(userPIN) with:
sizeof(userPIN)-1

15. Incorrect reference in Section 11.7

The text in the description of C_SetAttributeValue refers to Section
9.7 for details. This shall be replaced with a reference to Section
10.1.2.

16. Incorrect examples in Section 11.5

The examples for C_InitPIN and C_SetPIN in Section 11.5 shall subtract
one from the length of newPIN and oldPIN, i.e., replace sizeof(newPIN)
with (sizeof(newPIN)-1) and replace sizeof(oldPIN) with
(sizeof(oldPIN)-1).
